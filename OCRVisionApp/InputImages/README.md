# Testing OCR capabilities

In order to test the capability of Azure Computer Vision for Optical Character Recognition, we need a ground truth.

For this purpose we are using small portion of [IIT CDIP](https://ir.nist.gov/cdip/README.txt) i.e., 100 images with their corresponding metadata in XML format

Find more data from [here](https://ir.nist.gov/cdip/)

We have specially downloaded [images.a.a.cpio	2007-05-28 15:35](https://ir.nist.gov/cdip/cdip-images/) and used very small portion of it.
