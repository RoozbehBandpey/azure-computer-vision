Pear Mr.Hanmer:
Thanks for your letter of March 7th with reference
to the rat infestation problem at your tobacco storagee
in Reidsville, North Carolina.
I have inspected these storages and will discuss
my findings with you on Monday March 14th. My plans
now are to be in Richmond on that date, however, I
will call you before I leave Raleigh and if yon have
other plans, I will change my plane to agree with a
date that will suit you.
Hoping to see you within a few days.
