Dear Dr. Hockett:
The 1982 Deuel Conference on Lipids will be held March 3-6 at the
Highlands Inn near Carmel, California. Dr. Scott Grundy, Program
Chairman, has announced a tentative program which will include:
TITLE: Hyperlipidemia: Pathogenesis and Treatment
Hypercholesterolemia
Low density lipoproteins: chemistry, structure and
heterogeneity
Familial hypercholesterolemia
Polygenic hypercholesterolemia
Treatment of hypercholesterolemia - diet therapy;
drug therapy
Hypertriglyceridemia
Chylomicronemia
Function of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic triglyceride
lipase
Kinetics of VLDL-apo B
Regulation of VLDL-TG synthesis
Regulation of VLDL-TG clearance
Drugs affecting TG metabolism
Metabolism of VLDL remnants
Relation of hypertriglyceridemia to HDL metabolism
Apolipoprotein E metabolism and dysbetalipoproteinemia
Because of past support from The Council for Tobacco Research--
U.S.A., Inc. for Deuel Conferences, we are informing you of the
tentative program for the coming conference, and we are soliciting
your support for the 1982 conference. Deuel Conference policy now is
that donors of $1000 may have the privilege of sending one
representative and those contributing at least $1500 may send two
representatives to participate in the conference.

As in the past, the Deuel Conference maintains an informal
atmosphere, encourages free and open discussion, and is a forum for
the presentation of new and unpublished data in rapidly developing new
fields of research.
For your information, I enclose a brief background of the Deuel
Conferences and a copy of last year's program. We would be grateful
for your early decision on support for the 1982 conference. If you
are able to support the conference, please make the check payable to
"The 1982 Deuel Conference" and send it to my attention at the Hormel
Institute.
Sincerely,

Ralph T. Holman
Chairman,
Funding Committee
