RE: 5'S JAPAN
Your 20 cartons arrived safely. We read ventilation and obtained an
average of 19.6%. This was a surprise to me since at STC your Q.C.
people read 20%; therefore, we expected to read about 23%. Can you
please read ventilation on a few cigarettes from the lot that you have
there and let me know?
The samples that were made at our Development Center only reached 22%
instead of the 25% target.
We are reviewing the whole matter; however, it looks like we might
have to repeat the entire run with higher porosity tipping. I will
advise you as soon as a decision is made.
By the way, regarding the price increase for Project PARAGUAY, next
week we will meet with the Regional Director in charge of the
project. We will present all your figures and will advise you of
outcome.
Best regards,
