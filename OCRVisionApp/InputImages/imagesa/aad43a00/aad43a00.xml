J. R. Reid
FROM: Ni. B. Bennett
SUBJECT: Dept. 8700, Acct. 4111, Charges Pending Status
At the end of July, the status of charges pending on account 4111
was determined. The charges pending consist of units of work
known to be completed or entered into by contractors for which an
invoice has not been received but for which Loriilard is obligat-
ed. Other charges include unpaid invoices for virtually complet-
ed work with payment being withheld until the contractor com-
pletes all contractual obligations and various miscellaneous
obligations.
~ The attached surunary was determined from itemized information
contained on the Contract Status and Control document which is
maintained on a daily basis in the Life Science Section. The
determination was made to reflect the status on the last working
day of the month listed.
