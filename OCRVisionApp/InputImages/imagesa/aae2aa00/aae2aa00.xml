mentioned but also with respect to their aretabolic alterations and a possible
antagonism between these substances and the aryl hydrocarbons in the carcinogenesis
processes:
Tbe rabbit is being studied to gather information analogous to that
which is available for the mouse in order to appraise this species as a second
subject for such studies as have been mentioned.
Visible changes in chromosomes that occur following carcinogenic 8~
regimens are being appraised for their possible value as predictors of neoplasm '~.
U long series of experiments has been carried out in the effort to
T^
transform pure cultures of lung epithelial cells in vitro, and by transplant into
a homologous host, to produce carcinoma (without success).
Basic studies on immunochemistry have been maintained. I(A`"`l
Also, sophisticated studies of the kinetics of gas phase reactions U--~41
that might produce nitrosamines.are being investigated in model systems to estimate
the maximum concentrations that could be produced in tobacco smoke under real
life conditions. New chemiluminescence techniques for the direct measurement of
nitrosamine levels in actual smoke are being perfected.
