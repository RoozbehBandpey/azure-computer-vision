Subj: Social Costs Issue Project:
Report of Progress
---------------------------------------------------------------
tde have reviewed 67 "favorable" documents on the genera
subject of "social costs" of smoking. Excerpts from re
appended. Of these, ten were written by T.I. employee , and 34
by independent scientists or organizations. Among the 34 are
-eight documents critical of the 1985 OTA staff report on this
subj ect. _
This material may be assembled in a number of different ways
depending on the use that is to be made of it. Some examples
are: (1) briefing papers for use by our Federal Affairs and
State Activities staffs, (2) notes for use by our Public
Affairs spokespeople, (3) glossy T.I. publications for wider
distribution by the Public Affairs Division, (4) a publication,
in book form, written by one of the economists whose work has
been reviewed, and supported by T.I.
I hope to discuss each of these potential uses in our
meeting on Wednesday, January, 22.
