Subject: Ranch Roller Bag
Katie -- As discussed, Legal has a patent issue with the wheels on the catalog roller-bag. (We were
reordering the exact bag without branding for the Ranch program.) Beth and I presented this bag as a back-
up option, when we learned that there would be a long trademark search on the telescoping handle bag. We
were under the impression that this option would easily be approved. Unfortunately, this assumption was
wrong, since over the past few years (since the catalog version) a patent has been filed on the wheel
housing/mechanism.
Based on this assumption of clearance, we placed an order for the first 500 ($16,750) to meet the April
delivery date. Another PO was set up for the balance of 2,900 (for del. in late June). This PO could have
been cancelled any time before late April prod. start, if we didn't get legal clearance.
In discussions today, the following resolutions have been determined:
1) Wheeled bags already produced can be distributed at Ranch. We are confirming what part of 500 are
finished to-date -- estimate: 300. Firm answer tomorrow.
2) Balance of 500 -- and entire new order of 2,900 will be produced without wheels.
3) Spec Revisions will involve: a) Moving side handle to be even with other side handle. (This was moved
closer to the base of the bag to make for easier wheeling.)
b) Plastic runner strips on base of bag will be centered within length of bag. (Currently, they're closer to
top end to allow room for wheel mechanism).
We will have these spec revisions made, and forward to Christine for Jay Mohr's approval. Since we cannot
proceed with balance of order until we receive this approval, our second delivery date will most likely be
delayed. Call if you have questions.
