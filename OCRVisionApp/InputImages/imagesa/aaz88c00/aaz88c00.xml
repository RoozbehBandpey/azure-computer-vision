The entire study was administered in six central Location mall
facilities located' in geograph~ically dispersed markets (New York,
Detroit, Denver, Minneapolis, New Orleans and Phoenix).
CONCLUSIONS
~ In terms of impact and persuasion, the True Gold package
performed below the levels obtained for Raffles/Players and
Rio.
a Category and Copy Point recognition were stronger areas of
performance for True Gold'..
I On most attributes dealing with product performance,
personal identification and aesthetics, True Gold'held its own
relative to the other two brands.
I After actually viewing the True Gold pack with the B &amp; H
configuratiorn (hard shell/soft top), purchase intent
increasedsubsflantially and other measurements including
attribute ratings were quite favorable.
MARKETING IMPLICATIONS
The True Gold package while not impactful or persuasive does
communicate all the attributes that were set out as objectives.
It is a quiet pack which could relate to the low noting scores we
are seeing, in the portfolio.
