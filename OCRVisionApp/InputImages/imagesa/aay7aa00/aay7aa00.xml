Dear Clayton:

f
a

l	Lest Saturday, January 28, we had a conference on the research

application of Dr. Donald J. Massaro, CTR No. 592. Dr. Hockett,
Dr. Sue Buckingham and Dr. Massaro were present besides myself.
From the discussion it is evident that no-one knows exactly
whether after BCG the lung washout cells are mostly alveolar lining
`= cells or not. However, BCG is the best present method. Dr. Buckingham
a aftd Dr. Massaro are independently heading for the same objectives,
naggely fractionation and characterization of organelles in such cells.
t'lhpir methods and beliefs differ and the results hopefully will overlap.
Dr. Buckingham says Dr. Massaro`asks all the right ,auestions and
~! is such a bx•ight young man he,,frig4ens her. My belief is that project
'` No,592 should 'be ,ported and Dr.. Massaro encouraged.
Best wishes,
S C.S.
