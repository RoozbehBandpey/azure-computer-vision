To: . Dr. R. R. Seligman
Froen: • J. A. Remington
Subject: . W'.S.
As I stated in our last meeting, I think that we should
only use project coordinators where the normal organizational
structure is likely to not effectively handle a new project.
I believe the W.S. product represents such a case and
would like to suggest that a project coordinator be appointed
so that responsibility can be focused with one individual.
Although I have no strong preference for any particular
individual, we would!be able to have A. M. C. Luxmoore
available for this assignment.
If that selection is suitable, perhaps you could notify
Adrian for me during my absence so he would not be delayed
in giving the project attention while I'm gone.
