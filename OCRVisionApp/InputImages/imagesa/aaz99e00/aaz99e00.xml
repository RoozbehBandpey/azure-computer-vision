At the Tobacco Chemisis Research Confenenm in Lexington last October, w
discussed ways of looking at filter tip ventilation. Enclosed is a draft of
the "Methodology o£ Filter Ventilation Aaalysis". Yhis has been written for
Lmr Labocatory technicians' and thus coctains mairy very detailed direcLives.
Also, sone of the hincs that have been included are specific to aur equipment.
flovever, the technique, with a few eodifications for diffecences in apparatus,
is readily transferable from laboratory to laboratory. .
There i no attempt to present principles within the description of tie
methodology. The four papers that have been enclosed define the principles
behind the methndolnyy. The two technical bulleti.ns, enclosed, also review
concepts pertinent to the design and control of filter tip ventilatioo. I
would sincerely appreciate your comme3ts or suggestions concerning the en-
elosed literature, particularly the "MeGLOdology of Pilter Ventilation
Analysis". .
in October we talked about the possibility of son:c of Brown &amp; Williamson's
personnel visiting us here in Lee.for discussion and demonstrations of our
perceptions and techniques. We would welcome such a visit and hope that you
are still interested. . .
