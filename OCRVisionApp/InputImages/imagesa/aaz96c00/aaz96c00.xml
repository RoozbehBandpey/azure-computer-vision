110 East 59th Street
New York, N.Y. 10022
Dear Doctor Gardner:
For the past 412 years our firm has somehow managed to maintain its fees
for consulting services at the constant level of $ 30.00/hr (for our top
personnel) and $ 18.00/hr (for our technical support staff) as quoted in
our letter of June 20,1975.
However, increases in salaries and especially in operating,maintenance
and overhead costs during that period now force us to increase our services
fees in order to ensure the financial return required to continue providing
quality professional services.
Therefore, effective January 2,1980, fees for all rotessional services
provided to our clients were_ increased to $ 35.00/hr and $$ 20.00/hr for our
two categories of services.
We trust that these necessary and minimal increases in professional services
fees will be acceptable to the Council for Tobacco Research-U.S.A.,Ine.
Very sincerely yours,
PROCESS &amp; INSTRUMENTS CORPORATION
