RE: Interim Disnlay Prforitv Solutions
As a follow-up to our recent 50-1 meeting on the above referenced topic, we met
with Senior Managers - Retail to deveiop/finaiize specific guidelines. These
guidelines were reviewed with Ove and Andy, and received their concurrence.
Accordingly, attached please find the guidelines that should be utilized as we
move forward. It is important to emphasize that these are the guidelines for the
"interim period" only. The percent of calls falling into each priority is an estimate
by the group who worked through these guidelines.
The two remaining next steps include finalizing the brand load/creative look for
CAMEURED KAMEL, and ensuring availability/communication of the smaller
Moonlight Tobacco display for use as appropriate.
We will assume that this will be communicated to Field Sales via internal Sales.
Should there be questions or if additional information is needed, please do not
hesitate to let either of us know.
Sincerely,
C
