Statistics:
Thresholds: In order to determine differences between the thresholds for the nicotine
stereoisomers we used the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test to determine whether the
median of the differences between thresholds for R(+)- and S(-)-nicotine was different
from zero• This was evaluated separately for each sensation - 'odorous', 'burning' and
'stinging'. In contrast to S(-)-nicotine, the thresholds for the 'burning' and 'stinging'
sensations of R(+)-nicotine could not be determined In the concentration range of 0-180
ngJml for all subjects tested. If the subject's thresholds could not be determined in this
concentration range, we set the thresholds at &gt;180 ng/ml.
