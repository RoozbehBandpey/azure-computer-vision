HALF and HALF Filter Cigarettes
Second Half Radio Commercial Scheduling
Dear Hank:
Confirming our discussion last Friday, this is to recommend a plan for
utilization of the two HALF.and HALF Filter Cigarettes pools of radio
commercials during the second half of 1966.
Background The brand has been in radio since early April in four Marketing Areas.
Copy (through July 2nd) consisted of two 60" and two 30" "jingle" commer-
cials, split equally between Bob Harter and Waldo Cummings. In a meeting on July 1st, Mr. Heimann suggested that new "Folke Every-
where" copy be used in two of the original Marketing Areas during the
second half exteneion of the test, with "Harter/Cumminge" spots continu-
ing to run in the remaining areas. In the same meeting, it was agreed
that "Folks Everywhere" copy will run in Birmingham, the market which
was added ae part of an overall corporate heavy-up in advertising weight.
Recommendation .
On the basis of market eize and brand development, without consideration
of sales reeulte to date, the Agency recommends that the new "Folks
Everywhere" copy be run in the following Marketing Areas:
S-33 Houston BDI = 80* %u US pop = 1.27 C-18 Louisville BDI =139* % US pop =.76
Further, it is recommended that "Harter/Cummings" spots be utilized in
the two other Marketing Areas:
S-l2 Charleston, S. C. BDI = 62* % US pop = 1. 19 S-24 Evansville BDI = 116* % US pop = .67
*based on let Quarter 1966 sales data
