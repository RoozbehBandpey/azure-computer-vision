Now 100 vs. Carlton 100 Summary
. Now 100 has better rod formation and probably enjoys a cost advantage due to the
blend composition.
. Now 100 probably provides a cost advantage over Carlton 100 as it contains 3.5%
less tobacco.
. The Now 100 blend was slightly lower in sugars than the Carlton 100 blend.
. Carlton 100 had higher long strands and fewer fines than did Now 100.
. Now 100 provided 0.5 less puffs per cigarette than Carlton 100.
. Now 100 had a higher tar/nicotine ratio.
. Carlton 100 had a lower rate of making, packing, and carton nonconformities than
did Now 100.
. Now 100 had more wrinkles and more spots and stains than Carlton 100.
. Now 100's pack quality suffered from having 4.5% damaged packs. This may not
be reflective of manufacturing quality since both brands had several packs with
holes in the polypropylene film which occurred during tax stamping.
. Now 100 had more damaged cartons than Carlton. This also is probably not
reflective of manufacturing quality.

Making and packing quality of all products were all equally acceptable. No
statistically significant differences were noted in cigarette or pack defect rates
among the products. Montclair Lt. 100 Menthol had an unusually high carton defect
rate due to the quality of color and print of 50% of the cartons as well as damaged
cartons. The faded colors was most likely due to the age of the product.

Both Basic ULT 100 and GPC ULT 100 contained expanded stems. The stem
morphology of PM expanded stems is similar to our expanded sterr.ms. Neither is
fully detected by the QA stem analysis nor flotation test method. On the other
hand, a portion of the expanded stems noted in GPC ULT 100 blend were detected
by the QA stem analysis. The appearance of these stems differed from ours in that
they were larger and more puffed. It appears the stems had been puffed and
shredded, but not rolled.
Other blend differences noted were that Monarch ULT 100 contained less
humectants and total sugars than the other brands. Blend nicotine levels were
similar among the products.

OBJECTIVE:			
To assess the quality characteristics of RJR and competitive brands on an on-going
basis to ensure RJR provides overall product quality parity or better than competition.
SUMMARY:
This report summarizes findings for RJR and competitive products purchased from two
retail locations during the months of October and November. The brands evaluated
were Winston Lt. 85 (RJR), Marlboro Lt. 85 (PM), Salem Slim Lt. 100 (RJR), Virginia
Slims Lt. 100 Menthol (PM), Now 100 (RJR), Carlton (PM), Doral Lt. 85 Menthol (RJR),
Alpine Lt. 85 (PM), Riviera Lt. 85 Menthol (ATC), Sterling Lt. 100 Menthol (RJR), Alpine
Lt. 100 (PM), Montclair Lt. 100 Menthol (ATC), Monarch ULT 100 (RJR), Basic ULT
100 (PM), and GPC ULT 100 (B&amp;W).
RJR full price brands were fresher than the competition. RJR products also had lower
humectant levels and lower puff counts than the competition. Overall, the full price
products appeared to be at parity to the competitive products.
RJR savings brands end quality was at parity or better than the competition. RJR
savings brands had lower humectant levels and contained less tobacco than
competitors' products.
STATUS:
This study is complete.

(RJR) (PM)
Riviera Lt. 85 Menthol
(ATC)
Doral Lt. 85 Menthol was fresher than competitors. However, there were no
significant differences in % oven volatiles among the products which is noteworthy
given Alpine Lt. 85 was almost 7 months old on average and Riviera Lt. 85 Menthol
was over one year old. Carton code dates did not indicate either competitive
product had been in cold storage.

Construction of the RJR and PM entries were similar with both having a 27 mm filter
and 56 mm tobacco rod. Riviera Lt. 85 Menthol, typical of ATC products had a 25 mm
filter and 58 mm tobacco rod length. Visually, Doral Lt. 85 Menthol differed from
competition due to the use of cork on white tipping with gold stripes. Both Alpine Lt.
85 and Riviera Lt. 85 Menthol used white tipping with green stripes.

(RJR) (PM) (B&amp;W)
Basic ULT 100 was older than Monarch ULT 100 and GPC ULT 100. While not
reflected in % oven volatiles, Monarch ULT 100 had poorer pack seals than either
competitor which could lead to lower moistures over time.

Monarch ULT 100 had more expanded laminae with a higher filling capacity than
competition. Because of the greater filling capacity, Monarch ULT 100 contained
8.1 and 11.4% less tobacco than Basic ULT 100 and GPC ULT 100, respectively.

(RJR) (PM) (ATC)
Doral Lt. 85 Menthol also differed from competition in relation to the particle size
distribution of the blend. Doral Lt. 85 Menthol had less long strands with more
middlings and significantly more fines than either Alpine Lt. 85 or Riviera Lt. 85
Menthol.

Riviera Lt. 85 Menthol yielded significantly more puffs than Alpine Lt. 85 and Doral
Lt. 85 Menthol Lt. 85 Menthol. This is typical of ATC products because of their
longer tobacco column and higher packing density. Doral Lt. 85 Menthol, a more
highly diluted product yielded lower tar and nicotine, with more menthol.
