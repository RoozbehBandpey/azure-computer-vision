Dear btuss:
In accordance with our telephone conversation, I am pleased to
enclose to you.the Spanish translation of tha warning notice
and the timetable of publications of certain Spanish language
periodicals submitted by the Lorillard Corporation. As I under-
stand it, because of th® long lead time involved with certain
publications, some of the advertisements wi.].l continue to carry
the English version of the warning notice for several more editions.
I have been assured by both of the companies whose ads you called
to my attention that every effort has been made to change the
warning notice froan English to Spanish.
I appreciate your calling this matter to my attention.
With kindest regards and best wishes, I am
Sincerely yours,
,! Sorace R. Kornegay
