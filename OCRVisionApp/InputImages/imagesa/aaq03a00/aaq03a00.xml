I'm enclosing some information regarding New Jersey. We're expecting a
cigarette tax proposal of 25 cents per pack. We'll be making phone calls to
retailers and smokers to urge them to voice opposition to the increase, but would
also appreciate any help that sales can provide in activating retailers and
distributors.
The information provided includes:
• New Jersey Cigarette Tax Overview
• A newspaper article titled "Trenton's Looking At New Taxes"
• Morning Team Notes 12/4
• Target List - State Legislators that should be contacted.
If sales can help, please distribute any of the items above that are deemed
appropriate to regional personnel. They in turn can share this with appropriate
division personnel.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Suce
Bruce A. Cook
