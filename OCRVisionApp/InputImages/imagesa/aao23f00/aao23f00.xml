FROM: Ms. D. R. Ross
DATE: October 20, 1983
SUBJECT: ROUTINE QC INSPECTION OF COMPOUNDED FLAVORS AND INGREDIENTS
FOR EXPORT/144
In the future, I will not be performing routine quality control tests
on compounded flavors and/or flavor ingredients for export overseas;
the Petersburg Quality Department staff will be responsible for
routine inspection of these materials. However, I should be contacted
if there is any question about the quality of a material or if a
material is considered unacceptable. The new Inspection Program
Protocol is described below.
One 4 fl. oz. sample and one 1/2 fl. oz. sample of each flavoring or
flavor ingredient to be exported should be sent to the Branch Flavor
Inspection Laboratory for testing. If the flavoring or flavor ingre-
dient passes all tests, the material may be transferred to a labeled
shipping container, and the 4 fl. oz. sample representing the material
is forwarded to International and External Technical Services (IETS).
A copy Df the completed analysis sheet for the sample should be marked
with the material's specifications and sent to IETS with the 4 fl. oz.
sample. The drummed material will remain at the Branch until IETS
gives final approval.
