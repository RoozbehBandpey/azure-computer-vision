These estimates for job and compensation loss are based! on a
comprehensive study of employment and compensation in the U.S.
tobacco industry by Price Waterhouse in November 1992. The economic
loss estimates are derived by the Tobacco Institute using a
standard price elasticity model. A $1/pack increase is projected to
reduce cigarette sales by 17%.
