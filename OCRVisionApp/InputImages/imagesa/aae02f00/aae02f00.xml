Such people clearly do not represent the nonsmokers
we all know and work with. They would not last long in any
working environment where people must cooperate to get the
job done. And we doubt very much that the "zappers" will find
2,000,000 others to go along with them. Americans just don't
think that way.
Such anti-smokers are not only anti-smoking. They're
giving themselves the reputation of being anti-individualism,
anti-freedom of choice, anti-everything that does not agree
with their special prejudices. And in that they're as much
a threat to nonsmokers as they are to smokers.

A word to smokers
(about working together)
Whether you're a billboard painter or just, as you
obviously are, a reader of magazines, you've discovered that
there's a difference between nonsmokers and anti-smokers.
We all work with nonsmokers -- and they work with us.
Roughly 60% of the people around us are nonsmokers, and 40%
of them are smokers -- so we have to work together. And, like
our sign painters, we do.
Anti-smokers are a breed apart. They don't want us
to work together with nonsmokers. And they.go to some extreme
lengths to see that we don't.
Two examples:
1. A nationally known TV and film star was prevented
from performing by a band of anti-smokers threatening violence
because the star frequently smoked on stage. The occasion was
a benefit to raise funds for handicapped children.
2. The executive director of one anti-smoking group
announced plans to build an "army" of 2,000,000 anti-smoking
militants who would go about "zapping" smokers in the face with
spray from aerosol cans.
"You don't know what a rewarding feeling it is," he is
quoted as saying, "the first time you spray a smoker in the
face. It's hard to work yourself up to the first spray. It

We know that such anti-smokers do not represent the
great majority of nonsmokers. And the anti-smokers know it,
too. But there is a danger that others will think they do.
"When I went to the legislature," says one anti-
smoking lobbyist, "they thought I had about 10,000 people
behind me. That was a laugh. It was just me. I had the law
passed by myself."
If it is a "laugh" for the anti-smoker, it is no joke
for the rest of us for we must all, smokers and nonsmokers
alike, pay the cost of such foolish laws. All of us are losers
when any one of us is denied freedom of choice.
We don't think that, over the long run, that's going to
happen We think that, like our billboard painters, we'll go
on working together tmtil we get the job done.

A word to nonsmokers
(about working together)
Wherever you work -- even if you're a billboard
painter -- you work with smokers, and always have.
There's nothing remarkable about that. Forty percent
of the people around you are smokers, and 607e are nonsmokers.
Still, we work, live, and enjoy ourselves together.
Lately, however, we've all become super-sensitive to
each other and to each other's privileges and obligations.
And that's not a bad thing.
We agree on many things. There are places (crowded
elevators, to take the simplest example) where smoking is not
appropriate. In closed and private places, the ancient courtesy
of "Do you mind if I smoke?" is still the best rule. Smokers,
we believe, have become more generally conscious of that
courtesy. The occasional careless smoker, waving a lighted
cigarette or cigar, should, in our opinion, be as quickly
reminded of others' preferences by a thoughtful smoker as by a
nonsmoker.
There are those, however, who will never be satisfied
with our sensible accormodations to each other. They don't
want us to work together at all. Instead they want to segregate
us by law -- literally to build walls between us -- at considerable
expense to both smokers and nonsmokers -- in places where we
work, shop, eat or just go to amuse ourselves.

crowded elevators, poorly ventilated spaces or, indeed, in
any place where it is clearly inappropriate. And individuai
managers in their own interest should see to the mutual
comfort of their smoking and nonsmoking patrons. It is only
when the long arm, and notoriously insensitive hands, of
government regulators start making these private arrangements
for us that we all, smoker and nonsmoker alike, begin to lose
our freedom of choice.
In the long run, the wall-builders will fail, and the
walls will come tumbling down -- if not to the sound of a
trumpet, then at least to the slower but surer music of com¢non
decency and courtesy practiced on both sides of "them.

A word to nonsmokers
(about people who build walls)
The chances are that you made up your mind about smoking
a long time ago -- and decided it's not for you.
The chances are equally good that you know a lot of
smokers -- there are, after all about 60 million of them --
and that you may be related to some of them, work with them,
play with them, and get along with them very well.
And finally it's a pretty safe bet that you're open-
minded and interested in all the various issues about smokers
and nonsmokers -- or you wouldn't be reading this.
And those three things make you incredibly important
today.
Because they mean that yours is the voice -- not the
smoker's and not the anti-smoker's -- that will determine how
much of society's efforts should go into building walls that
separate us and how much into the search for solutions that
bring us together.
For one tragic result of the emphasis on building walls
is the diversion of millions of dollars from scientific
research on the causes and cures of diseases which, when all
is said and done, still strike the nonsmoker as well as the
smoker. One prominent health organization, to cite but a single
instance, now spends 28ph of every publicly-contributed dollar

A word to smokers
(about people who build walls)
It's no secret that there are some folks these days
who are trying to build walls between smokers and nonsmokers.
The theory behind all this is that some smokers annoy
nonsmokers and, of course, that can happen.
But if you want to get an idea of the ridiculous lengths
that some of the wall-builders would like to go to, you have
only to consider this:
In one state alone it was estimated that the first
year's cost of administering and enforcing a proposed anti-
smoking law and building the physical walls required was nearly
$250,000,000.
The proposal was, of course, defeated -- for the plain
fact is the one you have observed in your own daily life, that
the overwhelming majority of smokers and nonsmokers get along
very well and don't need or want to be separated.
This infuriates the wall-builders. Since they cannot
have their own way in a world of free choice, they would like
to eliminate that world by government fiat, by rules and
regulations that would tell you where, and with whom, you may
work, eat, play and shop. And the enormous burden that would
place on all of us, in higher taxes and costs, does not bother
them.
Certainly no one, including smokers, can properly object
to the common sense rules of, for instance, banning smoking in

on "education" (much of it in anti-smoking propaganda) and
only 2C on research.
There will always be some who want to build walls,
who want to separate people from people, and up to a point,
even these may serve society. The anti-smoking wall-builders
have, to give them their due, helped to make us all more keenly
aware of the value of courtesy and of individual freedom of
choice.
But our guess, and certainly our hope, is that you are
among the far greater number who know that walls are only
temporary at best, and that over the long run, we can serve
society's interests better by working together in mutual
accommodation.
Whatever virtue walls may have, they can never move
our society toward fundamental solutions. People who work
together on common problems, common solutions, can.

What the experts say: 1.
Dr. Edwin R. Fisher, professor of pathology at the University
of Pittsburgh and author Cf 450 scientific publications, said
in 1977, "My careful review of the literature, confirming the
conclusions based upon my own experimental data and related
work reveals a lack of scientific information which would
allow me to conclude that atmospheric tobacco smoke or its
constituents represent a health hazard in non-smokers."
Dr. E. Cuyler Hammond, a vice president of the American Cancer
Society, stated at an international conference held in 1974
that there "was no shred of evidence" that a nonsmoker can get
lung cancer from "secondhand" smoke.
Dr. Jonathan Rhoads, former president of the American Cancer
Society, said in 1975, "To my knowledge it (other people's
smoke) is not, in fact, actually harmful (to nonsmokers)."
Professor H. Schievelbein of the German Heart Centre in Munich
said in 1976, "According to the present state of our knowledge,
passive smoking does not cause physiological injury to non-
smokers."
Drs. Richard Schilling and Arend Bouhuys, who headed a Yale al
University lung research team, published this conclusion in
1977: "Exposure to low levels of smoke produced by cigarette
smokers does not result in chronic resoiratory symptoms or
loss of lung function among children or among adults."

Some people are saying America needs a lot of new laws
restricting smoking. Before you decide, you should know this:
OTHER PEOPLE'S
SMOKE HAS NEVER
BEEN SHOWN TO
CAUSE DISEASE IN
NON-SMOKERS.
You've probably heard anti-smoking groups calling for more
laws against smoking in public. Because, they say or imply, it's
a proven fact that smoke causes disease in non-smokers.
But the fact is, it simply has never been shown that smoke
causes disease in non-smokers.
Here's what an eminent doctor who was an advisor to the
Surgeon General's Committee was quoted as saying in 1976: "Irn
very direct terms there is no medical proof that non-smokers
exposed to cigarette smoke in ordinary relation with smokers
suffer any damage."
There's much more testimony like that. From government
agencies, other doctors, researchers, medical investigators.
Much of it from sources that are strongly against smoking. Some
of it is quoted in the box at the right.
Certainly smokers and non-smokers can sometimes annoy one
another. But what's needed to solve that problem is more courtesy,
not more laws.
More and more Americans are coming to believe that government"~
interference isn't the answer to every problem. We agree.
