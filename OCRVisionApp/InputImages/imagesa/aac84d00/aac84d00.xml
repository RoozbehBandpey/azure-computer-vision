RE: Center of Excellence in Toxicology
Weekly Highlights - Week Ending April 3, 1987
• Dr. Dan Funk, Del Monte Tropical Fruite, had asked for
information on Tilt, a CIBA-Geigy fungicide used on bananas.
The fungicide is permitted in other countries but is not
approved in the United States. CIBA-Geigy has asked for a
residue tolerance of 0.2 ppm and expects clearance by the EPA
in May or June, 1987.
• The WHO/FAO Codex Committee on Food Additives is endorsing too
many food additives according to Germany, Switzerland and
Poland. The Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA)
decided to evaluate natural products on a case-by-case basis
instead of establishing a blanket policy. The listing of
Sucralose, the artificial sweetener by Johnson &amp; Johnson, on
the next JECFA agenda may have angered FDA. The United States
delegation would have preferred to evaluate Sucralose through
FDA before placing this item into an international forum.
• Mr. Dave Taylor will go to Costa Rica to evaluate potential
employee exposure to methyl bromide. Del Monte Tropical Fruit
uses methyl bromide to fumigate pineapples for insects.
