The Honorable Joseph Moaldey
United States House of Representatives
Washington, DC 20515-2109
Dear Representative Moakley:
I am writing to express my support of your legislation establishing guidelines for reduced
ignition propensity (fire-safe) cigarettes; specifically your bill drafted July 18, 2000,
Nobody knows the dangers of fires more than the Fire Fighters whose jobs are to fight
them. We have seen first hand the personal loss and property damage that is a result of
careless handling of cigarettes. Your legislation would be a huge step in the right
direction by establishing an industry standard for safety. If lives and property are saved,
your work to pass this legislation will be worth it.
We commend your efforts and again express our support of your July 18, 2000 draft of
the bill.
Sincerely,
)• -/~` ~ Vt
